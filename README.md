**This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.**

# Conclusion

* This Netflix Dataset is a Unsupervised machine leaning dataset

* Data set contains 7787 rows and 12 columns

* Director features contains large number of missing values (more then 30%) so we decided to drop this director attribute.

* We have two types of content TV shows and Movies (30.86% contains TV shows and 69.14% contains Movies

* By analysing the content added over years we get to know that in recent years netflix is focusing movies than TV shows (movies is increased by 80% and TV shows is increased by 73% compare to 2016 data)

* By applying the silhouette score method for n range clusters on dataset we got best score which is 0.356 for clusters = 3, it means content explained well on their own clusters.

* Speaking about other different cluster methods, K mean, hierarchical, agglomerative clustering on data, we got the best cluster arrangements.

* 3 is the best cluster for this dataset
